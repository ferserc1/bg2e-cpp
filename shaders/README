# Build shader tool

This tool generates the shaders.h file from the src directory code. The configuration
of the types of shaders that will be generated for each platform is done in the
config.js file.

The resulting file is included in the project, and will be compiled into the code of the
graphic engine.

To compile a specific shader or list of shaders, add as a parameter the name of the shader folder.
that shader:

```
    node build.js shader1 shader2 shader3
```

After generating the shaders, all you have to do is recompile bg2 engine to be included in the source code.
